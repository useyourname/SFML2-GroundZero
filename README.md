SFML2-GroundZero
================

simple game to try out SFML2 with disastrous coding practices in use 

to run game (only works on Mac OSX, makefile uses GCC):
--------------
1) clone project  
2) cd into directory with cloned project  
3) open terminal and paste following: export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH="${DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}:./SFML-2.0-osx/lib" && export DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH="${DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH}:./SFML-2.0-osx/Frameworks"  
4) run Makefile by entering "make" without quotation marks in terminal  
5) run game by typing "./sfmlgame" without quotation marks in terminal  


playing the game:
--------------
press ENTER key to skip intro screens  
press ESC to quit game  
use arrow keys to move your character around  
run into the enemies from behind them to erase them  

note that the game is still incomplete and for now development is paused.
